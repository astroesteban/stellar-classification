# Stellar Classification

A machine learning project demonstrating the classification of stellar entities.

## Description

This project is a small demonstration of using machine learning classifiers to
predict one of three stellar objects: galaxies, stars, quasars from the 
[Stellar Classification Dataset - SDSS17](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)
dataset taken by the [ Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)](https://www.sdss.org).

See the [jupyter notebook](./stellar_classification.ipynb) for more details.
